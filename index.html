			<p>Hello. I'm Stacey Cullen, a barista living in Oakland, California. I love coffee, food, the Shins, Islay scotch, Oakland and Game of Thrones.</p>

			<p>I'm currently working as the lead barista at Twitter HQ in downtown San Francisco, where I pour really pretty lattes and delicious pour overs on Hario V60 and Chemex. I spend most of my time slinging cappuccinos, but when I'm not, I have some hobbies too.</p>

			<p>I attend public cuppings fairly regularly. My palate and overall coffee know-how have been greatly expanded by this hobby. I've also recently started trying my hand at roasting my own coffee on my stovetop. Admittedly I'm not very good at it right now, but it's definitely interesting experimentation.</p>

			<p>I'm also a very musical being- though the only instrument I hold any talent with is my own voice. I'd love to sing in a band, but the opportunity hasn't really presented itself. For now I'm content attending shows in the city, which usually happen to be postrock shows.</p>

			<p>Despite being away from the kitchen for the most part these days, I still get plenty of whimsical pastry ideas. I keep them logged in a journal, just in case they ever get the chance to see daylight. One of my personal desserts did actually come to fruition during my time at Alexander's Steakhouse- you can check it out below (hover over for details).</p>

			<p>My ultimate career goal is to open a bakery with an amazing coffee program back in my hometown of San Diego. Can you imagine anything better than a well pulled espresso and a freshly baked almond croissant, on a warm San Diego day? Yeah, neither can I.</p>

			<p>I also offer consulting services for those interested in opening their own coffee operations. I recently oversaw the opening of a coffee cart in SoMa (<a href="http://bulldogcoffeesf.com">Bulldog Coffee</a>), for which I conducted the product/equipment ordering, wholesale meetings, interviews and hiring, as well as city permitting. Feel free to contact me to discuss potential projects, or even just to talk coffee. Or pastry. Or Game of Thrones.</p>

			<p>Let's work together.</p>
